   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## 🔑 Required API Keys

### OpenWeatherMap API
- **Purpose**: Real-time weather data for flight routes
- **Get Key**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- **Cost**: Free tier available (1000 calls/day)
- **Setup**: 
  1. Sign up at OpenWeatherMap
  2. Get your API key
  3. Add to `.env` file: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`
  4. Also add your key to line 32 and line 234 in FlightMap.js for frontend weather map capabilities.

### OpenAI API
- **Purpose**: AI-powered turbulence analysis and predictions
- **Get Key**: [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use (very affordable for small projects)
- **Setup**: 
  1. Sign up at OpenAI
  2. Get your API key
  3. Add to `.env` file: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Backend .env file
PORT=5000
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Customize server settings
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

**Backend:**
```bash
npm start          # Start production server
npm run dev        # Start development server with nodemon
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
```

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Backend Deployment
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your environment
2. Ensure all API keys are configured
3. Use a process manager like PM2:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name "turbulens-backend"
   ```

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the `build/` folder to your hosting service

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend won't start:**
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Verify `.env` file exists and has correct API keys
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Frontend won't start:**
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Verify all dependencies are installed

**API calls failing:**
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure backend server is running

## 🎯 Mission

We're committed to making air travel less stressful for everyone. By providing free, accurate turbulence predictions, we hope to help nervous flyers feel more confident and prepared for their journeys.
